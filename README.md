# GoGreen Decor
**GoGreen Decor** is an Events Decoration Company that designs, produces and manages private and corporate events based in eco-design.

The importance of taking care of the environment grows significantly year after year, as we become more aware that everything that we need to live and survive comes from nature.
For this reason we must all be responsible and contribute our grain of sand.

## User Experience (UX)
### Target Audience
* Users that are looking for decoration and management service for their events.
* Users who cares about the environment or eco-friendly consumers.
* Users looking for innovation and unique decoration for their events.

### User Stories
 * As a user, I want to support projects/companies who cares about the environment.
  * As a user, I want innovative, quality products/services for my event that do not harm the invironment.
  * As the site owner, I want to offer eco-friendly products and services to my clients.
 
### Site Aims
* To provide the users with a professional service in event decoration management.
* To promote the importance of creating and consuming recycled and biodegradables products.

## Design
#### Colour Scheme 
I have chosen a "nature" themed pallete as it matches the theme of the site perfectly.

* I have used #606C38 for my H1.
* I have used #FEFAE0 as a background-color of the header and footer.
* I have used #DDA15E as a background-color of the text over the hero image, as a background-color of the About section and when the :hover selector is used over the nav-bar elements.
* I have used #C1CC99 as an alternative green for the Services section as #606C38 and #283618 were too dark.

#### Typography
I have imported google fonts "Roboto" and "Courgette" to be used in the site.

#### Imagery
I have used images from pexels.

## Technology used
HTML, CSS, Github/Codeanywhere.

## Features
GoGreen-Decor is a static responsive one page website with three sections with different purposes and background colors.
The website was built with a mobile-first approach, to ensure it is responsive. Then it was tested on various devices and screen sizes. 
 
### Navigation bar
The first element we see in the navigation bar is the name of the company, which is at the top in the center.
This element act as well as a link back to the top of the page.
Below the name we have three sections:  About, Services and Contact.
I have used internal links to create them, so users can reach each of them with a single click.

### Hero image
The main image reflects what the company is about: decoration and nature, full of plants, flowers and wooden furniture in a natural environment.
It also has a text that clarifies the purpose of the website.

### Services section
This section describes the service options offered by the company and gives an idea of the type of events the company can handle.
Two images are shown as examples of decoration inspired by nature.

### Contact section
This section contains a contact form with seven inputs related with personal data, such as full name, email address, phone no. and information about the event, such as event location, date and type.
The event type input display a dropdown menu of pre-defined options (wedding, corporate or other).
A text area was created to allow users to provide more details about their event.
The last element is a submit input.
Input validation was applied to all input elements.

### Footer
The footer contains contact information (address and phone no.) and social media links (Facebook and Instagram).

## Accessibility
I have used the following to ensure the website is as accessible friendly as possible:

* Semantic HTML.
* A hover state on the navigation bar buttons.
* A sans serif font as a second font for the site.
* A sufficient colour contrast throughout the different sections.
* Alt text to all images.

## Testing
### Manual Testing
Test has been conducted using Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge. Testing different devices and screen resolutions has been conducted using Google DevTools.
I tested it in Galaxy Fold, Ipad (min-width 768px), Responsive (min-width 992px) and laptop and desktop (min-width 1200px).

* Bugs
  
I have made last changes today: the size of the images in Services section, adding padding to the contact form and make the footer higher and for some reason when I enter "git push" the following message showed up:

That is why these last changes will not be reflected in the proyect.
